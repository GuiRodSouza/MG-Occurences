# Introduction
I live in a small city of Brazil in Minas Gerais and since a couple weeks ago I started noticing more police patrols on the streets. I study electrical engineering in my state's capital at night and therefore I usually get home at midnight.

Recently I've got pulled over when I was comming back home and that was the first time it occurred to me. However, this has made me think if there is any correlation between the frequency of police patrol in the Minas Gerais state and the increasing in documented criminal cases.

After the police approach, I immeadiately searched for any news about rising rates of transgressions in the state of Minas Gerais, although I only found news about the sinking rates about the national crime rate
