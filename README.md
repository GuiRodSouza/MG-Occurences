# Introduction
I live in a small city of Brazil in Minas Gerais and since a couple weeks ago I started noticing more police patrols on the streets. I study electrical engineering in my state's capital at night and therefore I usually get home at midnight.

Recently I've got pulled over when I was comming back home and that was the first time it occurred to me. However, this has made me think if there is any correlation between the frequency of police patrol in the Minas Gerais state and the increasing in documented criminal cases.

After the police approach, I immeadiately searched for any news about rising rates of transgressions in the state of Minas Gerais. I found several news about the increasing of violent crimes in the state and according to an analysis done by the [O Tempo journal][o tempo] over the [Public State Secretary of Justice and Public Security of the State of Minas Gerais (SEJUSP) data][public state secretary mg], there was a 5.4% increase on the violent crimes commited in the MG state in 2022 compared to 2021.

That was enough for my curiosity about beginning to do an analysis on the [SEJUSP's data][sejusp data]. Luckily, they have recently updated the data about the year of 2023. All the develpment was done in the Virtual Studio Code and using the last versions of Python Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib and Numpy.

# Development
Before even start reading the CSV files downloaded from the [SEJUSP data][sejusp data]
